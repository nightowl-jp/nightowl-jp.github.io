2017/9/8	Annotation of argument structure in Japanese legal documents	Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Argument Mining (ArgMining2017)	"We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents, with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these. The first step, described in the current paper, concerns content selection, i.e., the question of which material should be extracted initially for the summary. In particular, we utilize the hierarchical argu-ment structure of the judgment documents. Our main contributions are a) the design of an annotation scheme that stresses the connection between legal issues (called issue topics) and argument structure, b) an adaptation of rhetorical status to suit the Japanese legal system and c) the definition of a linked argument structure based on le-gal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report agreement between two annotators on sev-eral aspects of the overall task."	"Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2017.

2017/10/19	Designing an annotation scheme for summarizing Japanese judgment documents	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE 2017)	"We propose an annotation scheme for the summarization of Japanese judgment documents. This paper reports the details of the development of our annotation scheme for this task. We also conduct a human study where we compare the annotation of independent annotators. The end goal of our work is summarization, and our categories and the link system is a consequence of this. We propose three types of generic summaries which are focused on specific legal issues relevant to a given legal case."	"Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2017.

2019/6/21	A performance study on fine-tuned large language models in the Legal Case Entailment task	The 6th Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE-2019)	"Deep learning based approaches achieved significant advances in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, such approaches have not yet been evaluated in the legal domain compared to other domains such as news articles and colloquial texts. Since creating annotated data in the legal domain is expensive, applying deep learning models to the domain has been challenging. A fine-tuning approach can alleviate the situation; it allows a model trained with a large out-domain data set to be retrained on a smaller in-domain data set. A fine-tunable language model “BERT” was proposed and achieved state-of-the-art in various NLP tasks. In this paper, we explored the fine-tuning based approach in legal textual entailment task using COLIEE task 2 data set. The experimental results show that fine-tuning approach improves the performance, achieving F 1 = 0.50 with COLIEE task 2 dry run data."	"Hiroaki Yamada and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2019.

2019/8/2	Supporting content evaluation of student summaries by Idea Unit embedding	Proceedings of the 14th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, BEA@ACL 2019	"This paper discusses the computer-assisted content evaluation of summaries. We propose a method to make a correspondence between the segments of the source text and its summary. As a unit of the segment, we adopt “Idea Unit (IU)” which is proposed in Applied Linguistics. Introducing IUs enables us to make a correspondence even for the sentences that contain multiple ideas. The IU correspondence is made based on the similarity between vector representations of IU. An evaluation experiment with two source texts and 20 summaries showed that the proposed method is more robust against rephrased expressions than the conventional ROUGEbased baselines. Also, the proposed method outperformed the baselines in recall. We implemented the proposed method in a GUI tool “Segment Matcher” that aids teachers to establish a link between corresponding IUs across the summary and source text."

2019/12/11	Neural network based Rhetorical status classification for Japanese judgement documents	Legal Knowledge and Information Systems - JURIX 2019: The Thirty-second Annual Conference,	"We address the legal text understanding task, and in particular we treat Japanese judgment documents in civil law. Rhetorical status classification (RSC) is the task of classifying sentences according to the rhetorical functions they fulfil; it is an important preprocessing step for our overall goal of legal summarisation. We present several improvements over our previous RSC classifier, which was based on CRF. The first is a BiLSTM-CRF based model which improves performance significantly over previous baselines. The BiLSTM-CRF architecture is able to additionally take the context in terms of neighbouring sentences into account. The second improvement is the inclusion of section heading information, which resulted in the overall best classifier. Explicit structure in the text, such as headings, is an information source which is likely to be important to legal professionals during the reading phase; this makes the automatic exploitation of such information attractive. We also considerably extended the size of our annotated corpus of judgment documents."	"Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2019.
