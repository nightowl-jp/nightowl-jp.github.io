2017/9/8	Annotation of argument structure in Japanese legal documents	Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Argument Mining (ArgMining2017)	"We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents, with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these. The first step, described in the current paper, concerns content selection, i.e., the question of which material should be extracted initially for the summary. In particular, we utilize the hierarchical argu-ment structure of the judgment documents. Our main contributions are a) the design of an annotation scheme that stresses the connection between legal issues (called issue topics) and argument structure, b) an adaptation of rhetorical status to suit the Japanese legal system and c) the definition of a linked argument structure based on le-gal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report agreement between two annotators on sev-eral aspects of the overall task."	"Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2017.

2017/10/19	Designing an annotation scheme for summarizing Japanese judgment documents	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE 2017)	"We propose an annotation scheme for the summarization of Japanese judgment documents. This paper reports the details of the development of our annotation scheme for this task. We also conduct a human study where we compare the annotation of independent annotators. The end goal of our work is summarization, and our categories and the link system is a consequence of this. We propose three types of generic summaries which are focused on specific legal issues relevant to a given legal case."	"Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel and Takenobu Tokunaga. 2017.
