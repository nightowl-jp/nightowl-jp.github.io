2019/2/15	Building a corpus of legal argumentation in Japanese judgement documents: towards structure-based summarisation	Artificial Intelligence and Law	"We present an annotation scheme describing the argument structure of judgement documents, a central construct in Japanese law. To support the final goal of this work, namely summarisation aimed at the legal professions, we have designed blueprint models of summaries of various granularities, and our annotation model in turn is fitted around the information needed for the summaries. In this paper we report results of a manual annotation study, showing that the annotation is stable. The annotated corpus we created contains 89 documents (37,673 sentences; 2,528,604 characters). We also designed and implemented the first two stages of an algorithm for the automatic extraction of argument structure, and present evaluation results."

2023/3/1	Looking deep in the eyes: Investigating interpretation methods for neural models on reading tasks using human eye-movement behaviour	Information Processing & Management	"This paper provides the first broad overview of the relation between different interpretation methods and human eye-movement behaviour across different tasks and architectures. The interpretation methods of neural networks provide the information the machine considers important, while the human eye-gaze has been believed to be a proxy of the human cognitive process. Thus, comparing them explains machine behaviour in terms of human behaviour, leading to improvement in machine performance through minimising their difference. We consider three types of natural language processing (NLP) tasks: sentiment analysis, relation classification and question answering, and four interpretation methods based on: simple gradient, integrated gradient, input-perturbation and attention, and three architectures: LSTM, CNN and Transformer. We leverage two corpora annotated with eye-gaze information: the Zuco dataset and the MQA-RC dataset. This research sets up two research questions. First, we investigate whether the saliency (importance) of input-words conform with those from human eye-gaze features. To this end, we compute a saliency distance (SD) between input words (by an interpretation method) and an eye-gaze feature. SD is defined as the KL-divergence between the saliency distribution over input words and an eye-gaze feature. We found that the SD scores vary depending on the combinations of tasks, interpretation methods and architectures. Second, we investigate whether the models with good saliency conformity to human eye-gaze behaviour have better prediction performances. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation device called “SD-performance curve” (SDPC) which represents the cumulative model performance against the SD scores. SDPC enables us to analyse the underlying phenomena that were overlooked using only the macroscopic metrics, such as average SD scores and rank correlations, that are typically used in the past studies. We observe that the impact of good saliency conformity between humans and machines on task performance varies among the combinations of tasks, interpretation methods and architectures. Our findings should be considered when introducing eye-gaze information for model training to improve the model performance."

2024/5/11	Japanese tort-case dataset for rationale-supported legal judgment prediction	Artificial Intelligence and Law	"This paper presents the first dataset for Japanese Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP), the Japanese Tort-case Dataset (JTD), which features two tasks: tort prediction and its rationale extraction. The rationale extraction task identifies the court’s accepting arguments from alleged arguments by plaintiffs and defendants, which is a novel task in the field. JTD is constructed based on annotated 3477 Japanese Civil Code judgments by 41 legal experts, resulting in 7978 instances with 59,697 of their alleged arguments from the involved parties. Our baseline experiments show the feasibility of the proposed two tasks, and our error analysis by legal experts identifies sources of errors and suggests future directions of the LJP research."
