My name is Hiroaoki Yamada (山田 寛章). I am a master's student at [Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing Laboratory](http://www.cl.cs.titech.ac.jp/), [Department of Computer Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/cs/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04.html), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/). 
I am interested in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Especially, I study topics including argument mining and automatic summarization of legal documents.
