**Abstract**   
With the increasing demand for summarizing Japanese judgment documents, the automatic generation of high-quality summaries by large language models (LLMs) is expected. We propose a method to select exemplars using the nearest neighbor search for the one-shot learning method. The experiments showed our method outperforms baseline methods.
