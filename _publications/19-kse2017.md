**Abstract**   
We propose an annotation scheme for the summarization of Japanese judgment documents. This paper reports the details of the development of our annotation scheme for this task. We also conduct a human study where we compare the annotation of independent annotators. The end goal of our work is summarization, and our categories and the link system is a consequence of this. We propose three types of generic summaries which are focused on specific legal issues relevant to a given legal case.
