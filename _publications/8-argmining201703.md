excerpt: 'We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents, with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these. The first step, described in the current paper, concerns content selection, i.e., the question of which material should be extracted initially for the summary. In particular, we utilize the hierarchical argu-ment structure of the judgment documents. Our main contributions are a) the design of an annotation scheme that stresses the connection between legal issues (called issue topics) and argument structure, b) an adaptation of rhetorical status to suit the Japanese legal system and c) the definition of a linked argument structure based on le-gal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report agreement between two annotators on sev-eral aspects of the overall task.'

**Abstract**   
We propose a method for the annotation of Japanese civil judgment documents, with the purpose of creating flexible summaries of these. The first step, described in the current paper, concerns content selection, i.e., the question of which material should be extracted initially for the summary. In particular, we utilize the hierarchical argu-ment structure of the judgment documents. Our main contributions are a) the design of an annotation scheme that stresses the connection between legal issues (called issue topics) and argument structure, b) an adaptation of rhetorical status to suit the Japanese legal system and c) the definition of a linked argument structure based on le-gal sub-arguments. In this paper, we report agreement between two annotators on sev-eral aspects of the overall task.
