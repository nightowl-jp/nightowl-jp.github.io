excerpt: 'We summarize the 12th Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment. In this edition, the competition included four tasks on case law and statute law, plus a new pilot task on Tort law. The case law component includes an information retrieval task (Task 1), and the confirmation of an entailment relation between an existing case and an unseen case (Task 2). The statute law component includes an information retrieval task (Task 3), and an entailment/question-answering task based on retrieved civil code statutes (Task 4). The new pilot task is tort prediction (TP) and its rationale extraction (RE). As in the previous 11 competitions, participation was open to any group using any approach. This year, ten different teams participated in the case law competition tasks, with most participating in more than one task. Eight teams submitted a total of 21 runs for Task 1, and six teams submitted a total of 18 runs for Task 2. For the statute law tasks, eight teams submitted a total of 22 runs for Task 3, and ten teams submitted a total of 29 runs for Task 4. For the pilot task, four teams submitted a total of 10 runs. In this paper, we summarize the variety of approaches used, present our official evaluation, and describe our analysis of the submitted results.'

**Abstract**   
We summarize the 12th Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment. In this edition, the competition included four tasks on case law and statute law, plus a new pilot task on Tort law. The case law component includes an information retrieval task (Task 1), and the confirmation of an entailment relation between an existing case and an unseen case (Task 2). The statute law component includes an information retrieval task (Task 3), and an entailment/question-answering task based on retrieved civil code statutes (Task 4). The new pilot task is tort prediction (TP) and its rationale extraction (RE). As in the previous 11 competitions, participation was open to any group using any approach. This year, ten different teams participated in the case law competition tasks, with most participating in more than one task. Eight teams submitted a total of 21 runs for Task 1, and six teams submitted a total of 18 runs for Task 2. For the statute law tasks, eight teams submitted a total of 22 runs for Task 3, and ten teams submitted a total of 29 runs for Task 4. For the pilot task, four teams submitted a total of 10 runs. In this paper, we summarize the variety of approaches used, present our official evaluation, and describe our analysis of the submitted results.
