**Abstract**   
Legal judgment prediction (LJP) is the task of predicting the outcome of a court case based on input facts. Predicting legal judgment makes it possible to help not only legal professionals, but also the general public who are not legal specialists. An LJP system allows everyone to predict and foresee the outcome of litigation when involved in legal disputes. This article provides a simple introduction to artificial intelligence and natural language processing research in the field of LJP, reviews the recent advances in legal judgment prediction and related topics, and discusses the challenges and possible directions to develop a smarter and more trustful LJP system.
