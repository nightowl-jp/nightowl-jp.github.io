excerpt: 'This paper reports MONETECH&apos;s participation in FinArg-1&apos;s Argument Unit Identification in Earnings Conference Call subtask. Our experiments are based on the BERT and FinBERT models with additional experimentation on Large Language Model-based data augmentation, data filtering, and the model&apos;s layer freezing. Our best-performing submission, which is based on data filtering and the model&apos;s layer freezing, scores 75.54\% in micro F1 evaluation. Results from additional runs also show that the model&apos;s layer freezing and data filtering could further improve model performance beyond our best submission.'

**Abstract**   
This paper reports MONETECH&apos;s participation in FinArg-1&apos;s Argument Unit Identification in Earnings Conference Call subtask. Our experiments are based on the BERT and FinBERT models with additional experimentation on Large Language Model-based data augmentation, data filtering, and the model&apos;s layer freezing. Our best-performing submission, which is based on data filtering and the model&apos;s layer freezing, scores 75.54\% in micro F1 evaluation. Results from additional runs also show that the model&apos;s layer freezing and data filtering could further improve model performance beyond our best submission.
