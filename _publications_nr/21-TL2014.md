excerpt: 'We are accumulating electronic files of English composition by university freshmen. For the past ten years or so, about 50 to 90 students enrolled in three English classes taught by the last author are submitting 15 essays per year, each in three different versions. The first is what the students come up with in half hour or so in class after engaging what we call &quot;oral response practice,&quot; in which a group of three students in turn read a question card aloud, respond to the question and video record the interaction. Sets of 10 question cards around one topic are prepared by the teacher and distributed to the groups with a video camera. After class, students will spend some time to &quot;complete&quot; their compositions and submit them during the next class and review other students&apos; essays within groups of six. The students are asked to revise the essays and submit the final version during the following class. In addition to the students&apos; peer review comments, it would be desirable if the students can get feedback by statistical analysis of parsing and other processing of their own essays but the files submitted has to go through some pre-processing for the parser and analyzers to work properly. In this presentation, we report on your preliminary study and experimentation.'

**Abstract**   
We are accumulating electronic files of English composition by university freshmen. For the past ten years or so, about 50 to 90 students enrolled in three English classes taught by the last author are submitting 15 essays per year, each in three different versions. The first is what the students come up with in half hour or so in class after engaging what we call &quot;oral response practice,&quot; in which a group of three students in turn read a question card aloud, respond to the question and video record the interaction. Sets of 10 question cards around one topic are prepared by the teacher and distributed to the groups with a video camera. After class, students will spend some time to &quot;complete&quot; their compositions and submit them during the next class and review other students&apos; essays within groups of six. The students are asked to revise the essays and submit the final version during the following class. In addition to the students&apos; peer review comments, it would be desirable if the students can get feedback by statistical analysis of parsing and other processing of their own essays but the files submitted has to go through some pre-processing for the parser and analyzers to work properly. In this presentation, we report on your preliminary study and experimentation.
